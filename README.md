JavaScript & jQuery

This Repository is inspired as a refresher in JavaScript & jQuery practices from the series of front end development by author "John Duckett". Since working a full time job while completing Software Engineering degree course requirements had pulled focus into other Software Engineering / Development practices over time, this is a step towards reapproaching and further mastering JavaScript and jQuery skills in a focussed amount of time. 

Further inspired by readings and practices of the book "Deep Work" by Cal Newport and "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.
